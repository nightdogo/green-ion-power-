what if we use an air filter that picks up lose
elecltorns in the air aand then it gose to an
battery and a sensor that reads the all data
form the power air filter rail system 

what if we used the earth magnetic field to 
power a tesla coil system to power citys
we could use power form earths magnetic field 
and lose electrons in the the air to power citys
